# **Welcome**
+ Hi! Welcome to LFYS's first 3d game engine!
+ LFYSG3D is a lightweight, Java-based 3D software rasterization engine built from scratch. Designed for learning and prototyping, it runs anywhere Java runs — no GPU required.

  - For linux debian
    + Terminal
      ```bash
      #you only have to do this part once
      sudo apt install xorg default-jdk
      cd LFYSG3D
      chmod +x run
      #this is the file to run the code
      ./run
      ```
   - For windows
      + CMD
        ```cmd
          cd C:\Users\YourUsername\OneDrive\Desktop\LFYSG3D\
          run.bat
        ```
     + Powershell
       ```powershell
         cd C:\Users\YourUsername\OneDrive\Desktop\LFYSG3D\
         Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
         .\run.ps1
       ```
    
- And that's it! :)
# **Updates**
+ Updated GameObjects! Now with Animations!
+ Now with a save file format! .SSM (Simple Save Markup)
# **Building**
+ If you want to make a build of your game for windows, here is a little [ai chat](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/uDiGeRFC37ttzryJrmgDG) that really helped me out (Please DONT add anything to the chat that is unnecesary) 
+ If you want to make a build for linux, then [this](https://copilot.microsoft.com/conversations/join/77xZuFuQwtjxSieuB3Xyv) is the link for you!
**Have a Great Time!**
