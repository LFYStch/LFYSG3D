# **Welcome**
+ Hi! Welcome to LFYS's first 3d game engine!
+ LFYSG3D is a lightweight, Java-based 3D software rasterization engine built from scratch. Designed for learning and prototyping, it runs anywhere Java runs — no GPU required.

  -For linux debian: open the terminal
    ```bash
    #you only have to do this part once
    sudo apt install xorg default-jdk
    cd LFYSG3D
    chmod +x run
    #this is the file to run the code
    ./run
    ```
   -For windows: open the cmd
    ```cmd
    cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\LFYSG3D\
    run.bat
    ```
- And that's it! :)
# **Updates**
+ Updated GameObjects! Now with Animations!
+ Now with a save file format! .SSM (Simple Save Markup)

**Have a Great Time!**
